##[1.0.1] - 2017-02-08

### Changed
• 'halt' method of asynchronous behavior was renamed to 'halt_and_join'

### Fixed
• bug: Halting an async_state_machine lead to state machine::halt being called before joining the thread that processes events. 
This could trigger an assert if there were still events enqueued for processing. Also this could lead to the premature termination 
of async do behaviors or to async do behaviors not being terminated at all.


##[1.0.0] - 2017-01-20

### Added
• The logger now has got a halt_and_join method.
• Logging: A message that can be waited for. Needed for Y_ASSERT in order to guarantee that the log message from the assert gets 
written before the application terminates.
• New check: The target of a transition emanating from an initial pseudostate: It has to be a state.
• New check for local transitions: The target has to be a child of the source or the source itself.
• New check: A transition's source is a child of the target's parent state or the parent state itself, when the target is an exit point.
• wait methods in async state machine
• terminated method in async state machine for checking if the state machine is terminated or stopped
• (C++03) macros for creating event classes now support up to 10 parameters (from Y_EVENT_1PARAM_WITH_ID to Y_EVENT_10PARAM_WITH_ID 
and Y_EVENT_1PARAM_WITH_ID_PRIORITY to Y_EVENT_10PARAM_WITH_ID_PRIORITY)
• Y_EVENT_CREATE overloaded macro for creating event classes with up to 10 parameters
• overloaded macros Y_BEHAVIOR_METHOD_EVENT and Y_BEHAVIOR_FUNCTION_EVENT support up to 10 parameters
• Y_EMPTY_GUARD for creating an empty guard

### Changed
• replaced platform/compiler specific code with a single solution, removed dead code, minor refactoring
• renamed 'start_state_machine' method to 'run' for state_machine and async_state_machine
• renamed 'stop_state_machine' method to 'halt' for state_machine
• renamed 'stop_state_machine' method to 'halt_and_join' for async_state_machine
• renamed 'start' method to 'run' for logger and async_behavior
• renamed 'stop' method to 'halt' for logger and async_behavior
• examples are no more using the sxy namespace
• yasmine file structure refactoring. All source files are now located in the 'source' folder, the header files that compose yasmine's
  external API are located in the 'include' folder, and internally used headers are in the 'include_impl' folder.
• removed LL_PROTOCOL from log levels
• version.hpp is now under sxy namespace instead of yasmine namespace
• version.hpp is now included in the collection header yasmine.hpp
• The event ID of the completion event, COMPLETION_EVENT_ID, was changed to Y_COMPLETION_EVENT_ID and resides inside the sxy namespace.
• Transitions with guards are checked if they are active before transitions without guards.

### Fixed
• bug fix: invalid state exit on external transition returning into source state
• bug fix: transition emanating from or targeting the root state caused crash
• bug fix: when a composite state is entered via a choice, the parent state of the choice was not entered
• usage of macros for creation of event classes outside of sxy namespace
• log message from 'Searching for initial state in region' to 'Searching for initial pseudostate in region'
• wrong unused parameter on transition check


##[0.6.1] - 2016-12-12

### Changed
• 'behaviour' to 'behavior' in code and documentation
• replaced platform/compiler specific code with a single solution, removed dead code, minor refactoring

### Fixed
• bug fix: invalid state exit on external transition returning into source state


##[0.6.0] - 2016-12-09

### Added
• C++03 compatibility
• A new example: Events with parameters. It explains the use case of events with parameters macros.
• a new example of using sub-machine and variables into a state machine: Sub state machine with variables
• Macros for setting handlers (that expect a certain event type) as behaviors of states (do, enter, exit) or transitions.

### Changed
• 'behavior' to 'behaviour' in code and documentation
• Y_ASSERT instead of Y_LOG_AND_THROW when checking if the transition of an initial pseudostate was build in a compound transition
• event ID of completion event, COMPLETION_EVENT, becomes COMPLETION_EVENT_ID


##[0.5.0] - 2016-11-07

### Added
• Y_EMPTY_BEHAVIOR for creating a behavior that does nothing
• CMake files for generators under Windows (Visual Studio) and Linux (gcc, clang)


##[0.4.0] - 2016-10-07

### Added
• Y_OPTIMIZE_4_SPEED and Y_OPTIMIZE_4_MEMORY macros for internal optimization of ancestor lists (performance improvements)
• Y_PROFILER macro was added. When compiled with this macro, the state machine will count the events that were processed.

### Changed
• 'LL_OFF' as default log level
• assembly.hpp macros were improved to avoid ambiguous function calls
• when Y_NO_LOGGING is defined, no log code will be compiled into the library at all
• moved default implementation of dtor into cpp (behavior_impl and constraint_impl)
• removed namespace from assembly.hpp
• removed usage of unique pointer from timed event creator (performance improvements)
• The handle generator for the timed events is no longer a random function.
• vectors used inside algorithm are now created with a default capacity (performance improvements)

### Fixed
• error when compiling with gcc (const std::string transition_impl::get_transition_name)
• warnings concerning override when compiling with Clang
• if Y_NO_LOGGING is defined, the function 'log_version' is hidden
• a bug in the check of incoming transitions of a join


##[0.3.0] - 2016-09-16

### Added
• changelog.txt. It contains the changelog for the yasmine library
• assembly.h. It contains macros used for different tasks like creating the lambda wrappers for behaviors and guards (constraints)
• overloaded methods for adding transitions into state machine: different combinations of parameters for kind, guard and behavior
• priority for events and event priority processing in the state machine
• yasmine's interpretation of the choice pseudostate. The choice allows only one default outgoing transition (a transition with no guard).
• 'Y_NOEXCEPT' for all destructors
• log macro Y_LOG_HEX for logging hex editor style messages
• get_name method for events. It returns the ID of the event as a string if not overloaded
• event_template.hpp containing macros to created event_impl sub classes with fixed ID and priority (EVENT_WITH_ID, EVENT_WITH_ID_PRIORITY)

### Changed
•The extension of the headers is now .hpp instead of .h.
• Both the synchronous and asynchronous state machines use "start_state_machine" and "stop_state_machine" methods to start and stop the state machines.
• "start_state_machine" will return now true if the state machine was started and is running and false if a terminate pseudostate was reached or the state machine encountered a problem and is shutting down. Before the opposite was true.
• COMPLETION_EVENT will now have the maximum value of event_id (std::uint32_t -> 4.294.967.295 or 0xFFFFFFFF) instead of 0
• simple state and asynchronous simple state store an error event instead of a behavior exception
• Defects of the state machine will not be stored in the free store anymore. A copy of the object is stored instead.
• event's 'create_event' is now called 'create'
• constraint's (guard's) 'create_constraint' is now called 'create'

• code improvements (e.g. reference instead of pointer in signature of async_behavior::run)

• Removed the name parameter from transition and implicitly from state_machine::add_transition. A generated transition name can be retrieved by calling get_name()

### Fixed
• improved texts and log levels of logging calls
• The forward declaration headers of classes are now consistently included in the header of the corresponding class. Thus duplicated included headers could be removed
• 'event_priority = std::int8_t' instead of 'event_priority = int8_t'
• Problem with the URI of the state machine elements. Now, the URI contains all the element's ancestors
