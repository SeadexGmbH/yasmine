##[0.2.0] - 2017-12-18

### Added
• new methods to interact with the elements (e.g. get_child, set_parent, ...)
• new methods to interact with the state machine (e.g. remove_event, get_event, remove_transition, get_transition, ...)
• rapidjson_document.hpp as a wrapper for rapidjson/document.h and rapidjson/prettywriter.h
• delete_visitor for deleting elements
• has_error_event to simple state model
• add_deferred_event and remove_deferred_event to state model
• constuctor to easily construct an async simple state model
• setters in transition_model for behavior, guard, triggers, target, source, and kind
• methods to get the element that deferes an event and to check if an element deferes an event
• list of external vertices

### Changed
• internally use rapidjson_document.hpp instead of document.h
• event_model is now a class and has getters and setters for its properties
• use essentials as a library
• CMake: use external CMakeHelpers files

### Fixed
• read/write error event from/to model file
• read/write region from/to model file: 'pseudostates' list is read for backward compatibility. Just 'vertices' is written.
